			<h1 id = "story-info">I'm Brandon! I'm a rising senior at Cupertino High School. I'm a brother, a boyscout, and a seeker.<br><br> But more importantly, I'm a tino student. <br><br>I've been at tino for the past 3 years and can confidently say that I've been through it all. I've cherished the countless hours that went into homecoming preparation, despised the days awake on 4 hours of sleep, and grown from the community we've made here. I take pride in our community. We've done some amazing things <i>together</i>, from raising over $13,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief back in 2017 to just this month when we granted Tony's Wish to go to Hawaii. <br><br>We each have our own strengths, weaknesses, and talents. We each have our own vision of how we want high school to turn out – or maybe we're discovering it as we go. Regardless, we each have a piece to share, something to say, or a change we want to see. <br><br>And that's why I'm proud of our tino community. It's not because we've raised over $20K in the past two years alone, that we're ranked 27th in the nation for STEM, or that we have some of the most brilliant students in the nation. <br><br>It's because despite our differences, unique backgrounds, and diverse beliefs, we're willing to share, listen, and come together. <br><br> For the following year, I want to focus on <i>you</i>, as an individual, a fellow student, but more importantly a member of our tino family.</h1>

			<h1 class= "journey-info">I've served as the 2020 class president for the past three years, collaborating closely with my council to organize and lead school events. Here's a quick run-down of what I've done:</h1>
			<ul id = "council-list">
				<li class = "bullet-points">Organized three homecomings. Some highlights include organizing three dances of over 100 students, constructing a 10-foot tall paper-mache "pride rock", writing and directing a 15 minute skit, creating eight 30-foot long posters – all on a budget of $400.</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Fundraised over $9,000 through class apparel, in-school fundraisers, and community events. </li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Coordinated with council to organize Junior Prom which involved communicating and planning with local venues, vendors, and businesses. </li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Supported ASB efforts to raise $13,000 for Hurricane Harvey relief and to grant Tony's wish to go to Hawaii.</li>

			<h1 id = "vision-title">the vision</h1>
			<h1 class = "vision-info">Before we can aim for the skies, we have to lay our foundation on the ground. So let's jump in. <br><br>1. Improve communication and collaboration between ASB and campus organizations.</h1>
			<ul>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Streamline paperwork, forms, and application process for clubs</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Work with ASB Treasurer to streamline financial processes</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Create alternative fundraising opportunities to replace Clubs Day</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 class = "vision-info">2. Improve ASB transparency on two fronts.</h1>
			<ul>
				<li class = "bullet-points">First, increase financial visibility. Easily accessible public budget and spending spreadsheet.</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Second, increase visibility on what happens in the class. Monthly recap meetings to not only highlight month's activities but a commissioner's contribution and work.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 class = "vision-info">3. Implement an annual overarching goal. </h1>
			<ul>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Let me quickly explain this. We may take a quick detour, stop for a break, or lose or way every now and then, but a goal or vision keeps us in line. It reminds us why we're here and what we're working towards.</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">A school mission. It can be big, risky, maybe even a bit crazy. For instance, raising $50K for undeveloped schools. </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 class = "vision-info">4. Listen to what is being said.</h1>
			<ul>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Meet with club representatives every two months or after events to discuss or debrief.</li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Establish system with School Administrators to voice student's opinions. </li>
				<li class = "bullet-points">Improve cooperation and communication between class council and ASB.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h1 class = "vision-info">5. Continuing the legacy.</h1>
			<ul>
				<li class = "bullet-points">CHS has a long legacy of success with various events. We will build off what has been going well: Winter Formal, Homecoming, March Madness.</li>
